![alt text](https://rikovmike.ru/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vertex_jitter_1.gif)

A simple shader that adds a trembling vertex effect similar to the Playstation 1 render effect. The effect uses only a shader file, no additional c# scripts are required. All effect settings are located in the material inspector.

## How To Use

Use the shader on your material. To make the effect more realistic, turn off antialiasing on the texture and use low-resolution textures.
Ideal to use with Yet Another Demake Shader
